# Breast Cancer Prediction using SVM

This project predicts whether a tumor is benign or malignant using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model.  
It uses the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset and demonstrates a complete workflow for a machine learning project.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

## Dataset
The dataset contains features computed from digitized images of breast mass.  
- Columns include: radius_mean, texture_mean, perimeter_mean, area_mean, smoothness_mean, etc.  
- Target: diagnosis (B = Benign, M = Malignant)  

## Model
- Algorithm: Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
- Purpose: Classify tumors as benign or malignant based on input features  

## Project Workflow
1. Data loading and preprocessing  
2. Feature selection  
3. Splitting data into training and testing sets  
4. Training the SVM model  
5. Evaluating the model performance (accuracy, confusion matrix, etc.)  
6. Visualization of results  

## Goal
The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that accurately predicts breast cancer diagnosis, and to practice SVM implementation and evaluation in Python.
